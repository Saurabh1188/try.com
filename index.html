                    <P id = "p">    Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device or a network. While most cybercrimes are carried    
                            out in order to generate profit for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against computers or devices directly      
                            to damage or disable them. Others use computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials.     
                            Some cybercrimes do both i.e., target computers to infect them with a computer virus, which is then spread to other machines      
                            and, sometimes, entire networks. Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.    
                            These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or       
                            interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because         
                            there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative. </P>

                message to get people to share their personal information, passwords, or financial 
                information. Once they have this information, these criminals use the information 
                gathered to commit identity theft or to steal money.</p>
